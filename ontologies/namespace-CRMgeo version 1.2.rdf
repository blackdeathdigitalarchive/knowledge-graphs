Depending on the existence of natural boundaries of such things, the CRM distinguishes the instances of E19 Physical Object from instances of E26 Physical Feature, such as holes, rivers, pieces of land etc. Most instances of E19 Physical Object can be moved (if not too heavy), whereas features are integral to the surrounding matter.
An instance of E18 Physical Thing occupies not only a particular geometric space, but in the course of its existence it also forms a trajectory through spacetime, which occupies a real, that is phenomenal, volume in spacetime. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces, such as the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a number of individually contiguous spacetime volumes equal to the number of unconnected objects that constitute the set.
We model E18 Physical Thing to be a subclass of E72 Legal Object and of E92 Spacetime volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss the physical extent of an E18 Physical Thing without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E18 Physical Thing is matter while a spacetime volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E18 Physical Thing is regarded to be unique to it, due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E18 Physical Thing. Therefore this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.
The CIDOC CRM is generally not concerned with amounts of matter in fluid or gaseous states.</rdfs:comment>

Instances of E26 Physical Feature share many of the attributes of instances of E19 Physical Object. They may have a one-, two- or three-dimensional geometric extent, but there are no natural borders that separate them completely in an objective way from the carrier objects. For example, a doorway is a feature but the door itself, being attached by hinges, is not.
Instances of E26 Physical Feature can be features in a narrower sense, such as scratches, holes, reliefs, surface colours, reflection zones in an opal crystal or a density change in a piece of wood. In the wider sense, they are portions of particular objects with partially imaginary borders, such as the core of the Earth, an area of property on the surface of the Earth, a landscape or the head of a contiguous marble statue. They can be measured and dated, and it is sometimes possible to state who or what is or was responsible for them. They cannot be separated from the carrier object, but a segment of the carrier object may be identified (or sometimes removed) carrying the complete feature.
This definition coincides with the definition of "fiat objects" (Smith   Varzi, 2000, pp.401-420), with the exception of aggregates of “bona fide objects”.</rdfs:comment>

Instances of E29 Design or Procedure can be structured in parts and sequences or depend on others. This is modelled using P69 has association with (is associated with).
Designs or procedures can be seen as one of the following:
1. A schema for the activities it describes2. A schema of the products that result from their application.3. An independent intellectual product that may have never been applied, such as Leonardo da Vinci’s famous plans for flying machines.
Because designs or procedures may never be applied or only partially executed, the CRM models a loose relationship between the plan and the respective product.</rdfs:comment>

		    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en" rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations occurring in time and space.
It is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal extent. This extent is only the "ground" or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.
Often, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the "Neolithic Period", the "Ming Dynasty" or the "McCarthy Era", but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical E67 Birth can be seen as both an atomic E5 Event and as an E4 Period that consists of multiple activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.
As the actual extent of an E4 Period in spacetime we regard the trajectories of the participating physical things during their participation in an instance of E4 Period. This includes the open spaces via which these things have interacted and the spaces by which they had the potential to interact during that period or event in the way defined by the type of the respective period or event. Examples include the air in a meeting room transferring the voices of the participants. Since these phenomena are fuzzy, we assume the spatiotemporal extent to be contiguous, except for cases of phenomena spreading out over islands or other separated areas, including geopolitical units distributed over disconnected areas such as islands or colonies.
Whether the trajectories necessary for participants to travel between these areas are regarded as part of the spatiotemporal extent or not has to be decided in each case based on a concrete analysis, taking use of the sea for other purposes than travel, such as fishing, into consideration. One may also argue that the activities to govern disconnected areas imply travelling through spaces connecting them and that these areas hence are spatially connected in a way, but it appears counterintuitive to consider for instance travel routes in international waters as extensions of geopolitical units.
Consequently, an instance of E4 Period may occupy a number of disjoint spacetime volumes, however there must not be a discontinuity in the timespan covered by these spacetime volumes. This means that an instance of E4 Period must be contiguous in time. If it has ended in all areas, it has ended as a whole. However it may end in one area before another, such as in the Polynesian migration, and it continues as long as it is ongoing in at least one area.
We model E4 Period as a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr and Hiebel 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance we can discuss the physical extent of an E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomena while a space-time volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.
There are two different conceptualisations of 'artistic style', defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.
Another specific case of an E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena associated with a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.</rdfs:comment>

Such changes of state will affect instances of E77 Persistent Item or its subclasses.
The distinction between an E5 Event and an E4 Period is partly a question of the scale of observation. Viewed at a coarse level of detail, an E5 Event is an ‘instantaneous’ change of state. At a fine level, the E5 Event can be analysed into its component phenomena within a space and time frame, and as such can be seen as an E4 Period. The reverse is not necessarily the case: not all instances of E4 Period give rise to a noteworthy change of state.</rdfs:comment>

Time Span has no other semantic connotations. Time-Spans are used to define the temporal extent of instances of E4 Period, E5 Event and any other phenomena valid for a certain time. An E52 Time-Span may be identified by one or more instances of E49 Time Appellation.
Since our knowledge of history is imperfect, instances of E52 Time-Span can best be considered as approximations of the actual Time-Spans of temporal entities. The properties of E52 Time-Span are intended to allow these approximations to be expressed precisely. An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. Used as a common E52 Time-Span for two events, it would nevertheless define them as being simultaneous, even if nothing else was known.
Automatic processing and querying of instances of E52 Time-Span is facilitated if data can be parsed into an E61 Time Primitive.</rdfs:comment>

The instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of “immobile” objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame. It may be identified by one or more instances of E44 Place Appellation.
It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, we are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object – H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.
Any object can serve as a frame of reference for E53 Place determination. The model foresees the notion of a "section" of an E19 Physical Object as a valid E53 Place determination.</rdfs:comment>

An instance of S1 Space Time Volume represents the true (I) extent of an instance of E4 Period in spacetime or the true (I) extent of the trajectory of an instance of E18 Physical Thing during the course of its existence, from production to destruction. A fuzziness of the extent lies in the very nature of the phenomenon, and not in the shortcomings of observation (U). The degree of fuzziness with respect to the scale of the phenomenon may vary widely, but the extent is never exact in a mathematical sense. According to modern physics, points in space-time are absolute with respect to the physical phenomena happening at them, regardless the so-called Galilean relativity of spatial or temporal reference systems in terms of which an observer may describe them. Following the theory, points relative to different spatial or temporal reference systems can be related if common points of phenomena in space-time are known in different systems. Instances of S1 Space-Time Volume are sets of such absolute space-time points of phenomena (I).The (Einstein) relativity of spatial and temporal distances is of no concern for the scales of things in the cultural-historical discourse, but does not alter the above principles. The temporal projection of an instance of SP1 Space-Time Volume defines an E52 Time-Span while its spatial projection defines an SP2 Phenomenal Place. The true location of an instance of E18 Physical Thing during some time-span can be regarded as the spatial projection of the restriction of its trajectory to the respective time-span.</rdfs:comment>

If relativistic effects are negligible in the wider spacetime area of interest and the speeds of associated things, then there is only one unique global reference time. The typical way to measure time is to count the cycles of a periodic process for which we have a hypothesis of constant frequency, such as oscillations of a crystal, molecular arrangement, rotation of earth around itself or around the sun. The origin for a Temporal Reference System is fixed on a reference event. As long as the number of cycles passed from that reference event until now are known, the temporal reference system exists (E) and expressions in this Reference System can be interpreted with respect to the Reference Time.
A temporal reference system represents time as a continuous linear interpolation over the infinit series of cycles extended from the reference event to he past and the future, regardless of the temporal position of the mathematical point zero of an instance of E61 Time Primitive, such for instance the gregorian calender begins with the event an arbitrary positiong the point zero as beeing the date of the „Birth of Christ“. The actual date of birth of christ is regarded to be unknown and therefor is not the reference event.
The identity of a Temporal Reference System is defined through the type of periodic process it is based on, the reference event and through the distance of the reference event to the position of the mathematical point zero (I).
A value in the Reference Time is a temporal position measured relative to a temporal reference system. ISO 8601 specifies the use of the Gregorian Calendar and 24 hour local or Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) for information interchange.
In ISO 19108 three common types of temporal reference systems are explicitly stated: calendars (used with clocks for greater resolution), temporal coordinate systems, and ordinal temporal reference systems.
Calendars and clocks are both based on interval scales. A calendar is a discrete temporal reference system that provides a basis for defining temporal position to a resolution of one day. A clock provides a basis for defining temporal position within a day. A clock must be used with a calendar in order to provide a complete description of a temporal position within a specific day. Every calendar provides a set of rules for composing a calendar date from a set of elements such as year, month, and day. In every calendar, years are numbered relative to the date of a reference event that defines a calendar era [ISO 19108].
Specifying temporal position in terms of calendar date and time of day complicates the computation of distances between points and the functional description of temporal operations. A temporal coordinate system may be used to support applications of this kind. [ISO 19108].
Ordinal temporal reference systems as specified in ISO 19108 are no instances of SP11 Temporal Reference Systems as they do not define cycles of a periodic process but define a system of time intervals based on reverence periods related to certain natural or cultural phenomena.</rdfs:comment>

The spatial projection depends on the instance of S3 Reference Space onto which the extent of the phenomenon is projected. In general, there are no limitations to the number of Reference Spaces one could regard, but only few choices are relevant for the cultural-historical discourse. Typical for the archaeological discourse is to choose a reference space with respect to which the remains of some events would stay at the same place, for instance, relative to the bedrock of a continental plate. On the other side, for the citizenship of babies born in aeroplanes, the space in which the boundaries of the overflown state are defined may be relevant (I). Instances of SP2 Phenomenal Place exist as long as the respective reference space is defined. Note that we can talk in particular about what was at a place in a country before a city was built there, i.e., before the time the event occurred by which the place is defined, but we cannot talk about the place of earth before it came into existence due to lack of a reasonable reference space (E).</rdfs:comment>

It is the space in which we typically expect things to stay in place if no particular natural or human distortion processes occur. This definition requires that at least essential parts of the respective physical thing have a stability of form. The degree of this stability (e.g., elastic deformation of a ship on sea, landslides, geological deformations) limits the precision to which an instance of SP3 Reference Space is defined. It is possible to construct types of (non Euclidian) reference spaces which adapt to elastic deformations or have other geometric and dynamic properties to adapt to changes of form of the reference object, but they are of rare utility in the cultural-historical discourse.
An instance of SP3 Reference Space begins to exist with the largest thing that is at rest in it and ceases to exist with its E6 Destruction. If other things are at rest in the same space and their time-span of existence falls within the one of the reference object, they share the same reference space (I). It has therefore the same temporal extent (time-span of existence) as the whole of the E18 Physical Things it is at rest with (E).</rdfs:comment>

An instance of SP4 Spatial Coordinate Reference System is composed of two parts: The first is a Coordinate System which is a set of coordinate axes with specified units of measurement and axis directions. The second part is a set of reference features at rest in the Reference Space it describes in the real world that relate the Coordinate System to real world locations (U) and fix it with respect to the reference object of its Reference Space . In surveying and geodesy, instance of SP4 Spatial Coordinate Reference System are called a datum. In the case of spatial coordinate reference systems for the earth the datum consists of the reference points and an ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the earth. National systems often use ellipsoids that approximate their territory best and shift them in an appropriate position relative to the earth while WGS84 is an ellipsoid for the whole earth and used in GPS receivers. In engineering a datum is a reference feature of an object used to create a reference system for measurement.The set of reference features in the real world are subset of E26 Physical Feature that are within the described reference space at rest and pertain to the E18 Physical Thing the reference space is at rest with.
SP4 Spatial Coordinate Reference Systems have a validity for a certain spatial extent of the SP3 Reference Space and in addition a temporal validity. The combination of coordinate reference system and datum provides a unique identity (I). SP4 Spatial Coordinate Reference Systems may be defined for the earth, moving objects like planes or ships, linear features like boreholes or local systems. If there is a standardised identifier system available, such as EPSG codes, it should be used.</rdfs:comment>

An instance of SP5 Geometric Place Expression can be seen as a prescription of how to find the location meant by this expression in the real world (S), which is based on measuring where the quantities referred to in the expression lead to, beginning from the reference points of the respective reference system.
A form of expression may be geometries or map elements defined in a SP4 Spatial Coordinate Reference System that unambiguously identify locations in a SP3 Reference Space. Other forms may refer to areas confined by imaginary lines connecting Phenomenal Places such as trees, islands, cities, mountain tops.
The identity of a SP5 Place Expression is based on its script or symbolic form (I). Several SP5 Place Expressions can denote the same SP6 Declarative Place.
Instances of SP5 Geometric Place Expressions that exist in one SP4 Spatial Coordinate Reference System can be transformed to geometries in other SP4 Spatial Coordinate Reference System if there is a known and valid transformation. The product of the transformation in general defines a new instance of SP6 Declarative Place, albeit close to the source of the transformation. This can be due to distortions resulting from the transformation and the limited precision by which the relative position of the reference points differing between the respective reference systems are determined.</rdfs:comment>

The same limitation to precision is true for the temporal part of a SP7 Declarative Spacetime Volume due to precision of time measurement devices and of the determination of the reference event of a SP11 Temporal Reference System.
